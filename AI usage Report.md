## AI Tools Used
- **Primary tools**: Lovable AI, ChatGPT (GPT-4)
- **Key use cases**:
  - Scaffolding reusable React + TypeScript components (e.g., Button, Card, Modal)
  - Generating section layouts for Hero, Features, Pricing, FAQ, and Blog using Tailwind CSS
  - Assisting with Framer Motion integration for scroll-triggered and state-based animations
  - Writing type-safe form logic using React Hook Form and Zod
  - Structuring logic for the interactive pricing calculator with clean state handling
  - Debugging TypeScript and UI edge cases across components and responsiveness

## Sample Prompts 
1. "Build a modern SaaS landing page hero section with glassmorphism effect using React 18, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS."
2. "Create a dynamic pricing calculator component that updates cost based on ad spend, team size, and selected features."
3. "Write Framer Motion animation for scroll-triggered component reveals in a TypeScript React app."

## AI vs Manual Work Split
- **AI-generated**: ~65–70% of core implementation
  - Base layout structure for sections like Hero, Features, Testimonials, and Footer
  - Utility-first styling with Tailwind CSS (glassmorphism, responsive layout, buttons, cards)
  - Component scaffolding with prop types and motion integration
  - Initial setup of form validation using Zod + React Hook Form
- **Manual coding**: ~30–35% of final polish and logic
  - Customizing and extending AI-generated components with Radix UI primitives
  - Pricing calculator logic with refined state, conditional UI rendering, and edge-case handling
  - Tailoring animations, optimizing image assets, SEO metadata, and improving accessibility
- **Customization**:
  - Refactored auto-generated components for consistent spacing (8px grid), color psychology, and semantic structure
  - Integrated custom themes and dark/light toggle with smooth transitions
  - Manually adjusted typography, navigation behavior, and animation timing for responsive UX across breakpoints
